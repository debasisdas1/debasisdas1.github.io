# Data Structures

## Stack
* Stack is one of the simplest data structures.
* Stack has LIFO - Last In first out order
* Stack is like an array but with limited functionality
	* Push to add a new object to the top
	* Pop to remove the last object
	* top to look at the top most/last element without removing it
