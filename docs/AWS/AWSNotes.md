## AWS Services and Features
### Analytics

- Amazon Athena
	- Interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. 
	- Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, 
	- Pay only for the queries that you run.
	- With Athena, thereâ€™s no need for complex ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis. 
	- Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema versioning.
